# Deploying the ContosoBNB Web Applicaiton #

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

This take way resource is a short-term vacation-rental web application called ContosoBNB. The application incorporates the Project Local Insights API from Cognitive Services to provide a custom score for the attractiveness of a location according to a user's select preferences. The resultant application is able to render a Bing Maps image of several cities within the United States, where circles appear on the rendered map to represent neighborhoods, and each circle displays a number that corresponds to the number of available properties within that neighborhood. Neighborhoods are also rated according to preference settings that the user can adjust.

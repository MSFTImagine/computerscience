# Building a Custom Dashboard in a Day#

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##In this lab, we will explore the rich reporting and analytical capabilities of Power BI using the Power BI Designer. 
At a basic level BI Designer allows a business user with a working knowledge of Excel to create and share rich reports from a variety of sources they have access to both inside their organisation and available publicly.  However, it can go far beyond this to create complex business calculations across disparate sets of data and also allows access to certain data to be restricted.  
It’s also worth mentioning that currently Power BI is only available as a cloud service although it can access and render data from on premises servers via the Power BI Personal Gateway To sign up for a trial of Power BI service you’ll need an organisation e-mail account (as to a personal one like google.com, outlook.com etc.)   
Much of the functionality in the BI Designer has been available via the Power * (Power Pivot, Power Query, Power Map etc.) add-ins to Excel but there is no dependency on having Excel to use the Designer tool as we shall see.  
Data Set  
The dataset you will you use today is a sales and market share analysis.  This type of analysis is very common for the office of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).  Unlike the office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a CMO is focused not only on company’s performance internally (how well do our products sell) but also externally (how well do we do against the competing products). 
The company, VanArsdel, manufactures expensive electronic products that could be used for fun as well as work and it sells them directly to consumers nationwide as well as several other countries.  VanArsdel and its competitors have retained a 3rd party marketing company to collect and anonymize industry sales so that all participants can benchmark themselves.

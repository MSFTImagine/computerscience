# ASSIGNMENT 2, DESIGN CHALLENGE

The design challenge is where you get to put all you have learned into action by building a pitch.
 
A pitch is essentially a plan that one presents to potential investors in a product, project or business.
 
Day 4 is split into two parts –
- Part 1, create pitches
- Part 2, critique of pitches
In part 1 you will prepare a pitch based on ideas for an AI-based product that helps stop a species from becoming extinct.
 
In part 2, your tutors and mentors will play the role of investors. Your task is to persuade these investors to fund your product’s development.
 
There will be 1 winner, and the criteria that the investors will be using is as follows:
1.	Realistic impact on a big, clearly-defined problem, 20%
2.	Description of how machine learning will be used, especially with regards to the data and models, 30%
3.	Demo of the key principles in Excel or Python, 20%
4.	Clarity of communication, 10%
5.	Time keeping – minus 10% for each 15 seconds over the pitch time
6.	During the critique of the other team’s pitches, your team can earn 5% points up to a maximum of 20% for each good question that you put to another team during the critique.

## Preparation

You will need to produce a PowerPoint deck for the pitch. Try to use diagrams rather than words on the slides. Your slides should follow the AI development process that we studied at the start of this hackathon, with one slide explaining each step in the process.  
 
You will need the following 7 slides –
- Title slide - stating the name of your team and your idea
- Problem definition – in one short sentence, what problem will your product solve?
- Your hypothesis, which should explain how you think AI can help solve the problem
- You will need a slide explaining what data you need , where you will get it from and how you will prepare it for machine learning
- In a ‘modelling’ slide, you will need to explain which machine learning model is the best fit to solve the problem
- You will need two ‘deploy’ slides -
    - The first needs to show the Technical components as ‘building blocks’
    - The second needs to show screen shots or a short video showing a demo of your model working with some data.   
 
You will need to load your presentation into Teams before the start of the critique.

## Delivery
You will have 5 minutes only to present, and then there will be 5 mins Q&A.

## Critique
Whilst other teams are presenting, it will be tempting for you to disengage from the critique. However, you can earn extra points for your team if you pay attention to the other pitches and contribute questions.

## Design A Web Service That Protects An Endangered Species 
Design and build a pitch for an AI-based service that protects an endangered species.     

## Present, And Participate In The Critique  
Don’t forget that during the critique of the other team’s pitches, your team can earn 5% points up to a maximum of 20% for each good question that you put to another team during the critique.

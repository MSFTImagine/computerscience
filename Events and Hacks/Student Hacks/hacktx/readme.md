## Social media guidelines
[Read me and learn how to Tweet/Facebook!](../socialguidance.pdf)

## Being a mentor
**What resources do I point hackers to?**
[aka.ms/hackwithazure](https://aka.ms/hackwithazure) is a good place to start (feel free to fork, pull request and contribute) but also, whatever **you** think is a good resource!

**How do I talk to hackers?** 
Sometimes hackers may be a little shy about approaching company reps, so feel free to walk around the hacking area and introduce yourself, ask them what theyâ€™re working on, and offer your expertise!


## Being a judge
We're going to be judging projects that used Azure for the Azure Champ Challenge. Some of you are already signed up to be judges, but even if you're not, please be around at 12:30pm on Sunday during Azure prize juding huddle in case we need extra hands ðŸ˜Š

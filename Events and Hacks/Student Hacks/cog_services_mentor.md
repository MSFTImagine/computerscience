# Cog Services info for hackathon mentors

How we talk about cog services:
- Microsoft AI as a unified platform
- Microsoft wants to democratize AI - not just for data scientists
- Users have 30 models at our disposal that used to be super hard to do

How to get in touch with cog services engineers:
- Slack group: https://azureappliedai.slack.com/ 
- StackOverflow – use “microsoft-cognitive” tag

What to demo:
- [aka.ms/intelligentkiosk](https://aka.ms/intelligentkiosk) (only available for @microsoft.com accounts)
Intelligent kiosk – can find less-up-to date version on Github
- [AI lab](https://www.ailab.microsoft.com/)
   - JFK files search is a great demo
   - 2 good bots demos (Build a Bot and Drawing Bot)
- AzureSamples repo on github (search for cognitive services) - [link with search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=cognitive+services&type=&language=)
- [AI School](https://aischool.microsoft.com/en-us/home) – probably too in-depth for a hackathon, but students can explore on their own
- [AI Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/) – more complex than what cog services allow for

Demo strategy:
- Briefly overview the portfolio
- Dive into a couple key ones
- Show sample code!!

Pain points to be aware of:
- Using just one service is nice and easy. Combining services is where things get tricky.
- Still need a separate key for each service -> Lots of grossness around key management issues.
- e.g. using QnA maker + spell check + bot together

Relationship between different parts of Microsoft AI platform
- Cog services = when you’re okay using OUR data
- Custom services = when you want to use OUR model but YOUR data (Speech, language, vision)
   - (if none of those work) = export as ONNX model and then import into developer tools 

How to talk about Azure’s AI offerings vs. AWS vs. GCP
- If you’re asked about a comparison with AWS sagemaker / GCP automl… 
- Try not to go into details, but use as an opportunity to highlight our strengths. E.g. “I’m not sure… but WE are the best at adapting models. WE are unique in our AI principles policy” (huge differentiator)

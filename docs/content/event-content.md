## :gb: :spider_web: A Workshop to host a students resume live on an Azure App Service.
(I have conducted this workshop atleast 6 times. Approx time needed for the successful completion of this workshop - 4hrs minimum)

### Need for such event?
- Usually students find it engaging if the content of the workshop will help them in their placements and job hiring procedure.
- Students are all the time engaged in maintaining their portfolio and resume.
- Making this website will give them a final product that will fulfill their goal of making a live resume as well as teach them Azure App Services
- **Question:** There are many documents and tutorials that teach hosting a website on Azure. So what is so special about this tutorial? **Answer** - This tutorial doesn't need any deployment of asp.net or node.js or all the complex things that are explained in the other docs and tutorials. Its a simple HTML/CSS deployment which invlolves hands-on Azure meanwhile learning GitHub.
